Carpentry TODO:

Deck Editor - in order  to show main/sideboard, I think I need to update the data structure of the deck detail

Instead of inventory DTOs, I should have a DeckCardDto
	This should store its own category, maybe
	OR - "card overview" natural key === Name + Category
	
	Either way, right now, if I have 1 card in mainboard and 1 in sideboard, all show in sideboard
	
	I MIGHT be able to keep this same structure and just change how I group cards client-sideboard
	I'd also want to filter details when a card is selected, to match the same category
