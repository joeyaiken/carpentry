    Tasks Priority:
        --Get app nav working
        --Add deck property for "is up to date"

            --LIST decks

        //after this, options include 
        //  start refactoring DB storage
        //      Prob shouldn't remove ILandCount until the deck editor groups same cards
        //      For now, the 
        //  Log current decks with in-place DB structure?
        //      It doesn't make sense to do this until we're storing name AND set
        //      At that point, we'll prob have lands working differently
        //  Start refactoring search
        //      options for local vs web
        //      additional search filters
        //      actually search on "enter" (make form?)

    Goals
        Have all current decks logged
        Have all rares logged

        Once I have all data logged, I can work on stats, stores, and deck building tools
        I should probably create the basic stores now, but not fully populate them
    
    
    Add overview page
        lists decks & deck stats
        Can be used to navigate to decks
    Refactor AppNav to be a constant left bar?
    Add card index JSON files for specific sets
    Update decks to store Name / Set combos for cards, not just Name
    Update decks to store lands in the card list, not a unique object
