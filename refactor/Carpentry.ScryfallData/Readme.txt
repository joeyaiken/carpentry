THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE DELETED
Any relevant contents should be moved to Carpentry.Data.Scryfall


This project caches card data from Scryfall, avoiding having to query their API too many times when actively developing

I believe if I really wanted to get fancy with this project, that it might be a good candidate for a PoC microservice
